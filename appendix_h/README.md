## Individual Achievements and Areas for Opportunity (Midpoint Feedback)

### Achievements (related to axes of performance)

#### Productivity
- Completed the analytics ramp-up plan ahead of schedule, including understanding the data model, reproducing core SQL queries, and delivering early versions of the onboarding funnel analysis.
- Logged and actively participated in more than 30 one-to-one working sessions and over 40 shadowing or observation meetings with data analysts, product managers, and operations leads across Misr Digital Innovation, which accelerated my understanding of how analytics supports the digital bank.
- Took the initiative to organize an Intern Analytics Feedback Session, where interns and junior analysts reviewed each other’s work, shared lessons on KPI design, and aligned on expectations for upcoming deliverables.

#### Quality of work
- Designed and implemented a structured intern performance review template tailored to analytics work at MDI. The template is now used by other interns to document their deliverables, impact metrics, and evidence links in a consistent way.
- Contributed to competitive and benchmarking analyses for peer digital banks and fintechs, under Ahmad’s guidance, translating market observations into testable hypotheses and KPI movements for MDI’s product roadmap.
- Supported the analytics work for a digital banking growth initiative by exploring case studies on onboarding funnels, activation nudges, and retention tactics. This helped the team frame experiments for MDI’s own app and gave other interns a reference for high quality analytic documentation.

#### Communication and collaboration
- Collaborated on side projects with colleagues in analytics and product, including improving the internal time allocation analysis, refining the KPI dictionary, and proposing additional checks for the data quality framework.
- Participated in interviews and working sessions with product, CX, and risk teams, collecting precise requirements and sharing early analysis in a clear and structured way.
- Built relationships through regular 1:1s with analysts, data engineers, and product managers in different squads, which gave me a broader view of how data flows from operational systems into decision-making at the bank.
- Received informal recognition from colleagues for my support in documentation, including editing internal presentations and helping peers structure their analysis slides.

#### Initiative and independence
- Proactively created internal enablement tools, such as the performance review template and the time allocation methodology, to help interns and junior team members track their work and reflect on how they spend their time.
- Shadowed senior data analysts and product managers on critical projects, including onboarding funnel reviews, KYC operations analysis, and channel performance deep dives. This helped me learn advanced analytics patterns while also contributing tangible work products.
- Independently explored the MDI analytics stack, including SQL queries, Python scripts, and dashboard prototypes, and regularly came to meetings with specific questions or suggestions rather than waiting for instructions.

#### Learning speed
- Extended my learning beyond my immediate squad by shadowing analysts who focus on different regions and customer segments, which exposed me to varied user behaviors and operational realities.
- Attended sessions with subject matter experts on core topics such as onboarding flows, risk and KYC policies, payments, and customer support operations, and then applied those learnings to improve my own metrics and analysis.

## Challenges and Support Needed
- Balancing volume of interactions with deep work. Managing a large number of meetings, shadowing sessions, and side tasks, while preserving enough uninterrupted time for deep analytical work, remains challenging. I want to strengthen my skills in strategic planning and prioritization, and I would benefit from mentorship on how experienced analysts structure their week and protect focus time.
- Communicating contributions beyond my immediate manager. I sometimes struggle to make my impact visible to the broader team. I plan to take more initiative in presenting my work in team meetings, sharing concise written updates, and posting short summaries of key insights in the relevant channels so that my contributions are clearer beyond Ahmad and the core project group.

## Overall Program Reflections

### Project plan: ramp-up, milestones, and goals
- Completed the core ramp-up milestones, including onboarding to MDI’s data model, understanding the synthetic data pipeline, and reproducing key KPIs using SQL and Python.
- Delivered early versions of the funnel analysis, KPI summary tables, data quality checks, and the intern performance template according to, or ahead of, the agreed timelines.
- My current focus is on deepening the strategic contribution of the work, for example by tying funnel findings more explicitly to experiment proposals and product decisions.
- I am actively learning how to rebalance my time so that operational tasks, such as routine queries and documentation, do not crowd out higher-leverage analytical work.

### Manager and peer support
- I receive consistent and actionable feedback from my manager, Ahmad, who helps me prioritize and refine my deliverables while still giving me room to work autonomously.
- Peers and other team members are collaborative and approachable, which has made it easy to ask questions, validate assumptions, and iterate quickly on analysis.
- Regular 1:1s and shadowing sessions have clarified expectations and helped me understand how my work feeds into product, risk, and customer experience decisions.
- I am still working on being more proactive in sharing my progress with the wider chapter and not only within my immediate project circle.

### Tooling, testing, and documentation
- Access to the analytics environment, including SQLite, Python notebooks, internal dashboards, and documentation, has been very strong and has supported my learning curve.
- I would benefit from more structured exposure to how senior analysts design experiments and prioritize backlogs, for example templates for analysis plans or experiment design docs, to improve my own strategic planning skills.

### Inclusion in team, organization, and internship program
- The team has been welcoming and inclusive, which made the transition into the internship smooth and encouraged me to ask questions early.
- Daily interaction, from working sessions to informal check-ins, has created a strong sense of belonging and has motivated me to push the quality of my work.
- Taking part in squad meetings, cross-functional sessions, and internal knowledge shares has deepened my understanding of how the digital bank operates and how data is used in real decisions.

### Other factors impacting the internship
- Balancing learning new tools and concepts with delivering production-ready analysis requires deliberate time management, especially when new ideas emerge during shadowing sessions.
- The supportive environment, along with Ahmad’s guidance and peer mentorship, has been crucial in helping me navigate these trade-offs and continue progressing.

## Feedback from Ahmad

### Considering Ali’s work, is he meeting expectations along the axes of intern performance?
Yes.

### Manager summary of progress and impact during the first half of the internship
Ali has demonstrated an exceptional level of performance during the first half of his internship, consistently meeting and often surpassing expectations across the main axes of intern performance. His proactive and autonomous approach has made him a valuable contributor to the analytics team, and he is able to drive projects forward with limited supervision while handling ambiguity effectively.

His initiative is particularly strong. Ali independently manages a variety of tasks, including analytics deliverables, shadowing sessions, documentation, and research, while also taking on responsibilities beyond his core assignments. For example, he organized an intern feedback session focused on analytics work, which helped interns share lessons and align on expectations. This shows both leadership and a collaborative mindset.

Ali is highly resourceful. He unblocks himself by consulting documentation, exploring dashboards, reviewing code, and talking to analysts or product managers when needed. This thorough approach leads to work that is accurate and well-reasoned. His productivity is impressive. He is ahead of schedule on his main projects, such as the KPI dictionary implementation, the funnel and channel analysis, and the data quality framework, and he has also contributed to side projects like the time allocation methodology.

He has ramped up quickly in understanding the project space, the underlying data model, and the tools used at MDI. He proactively arranged conversations with subject matter experts even before formal training sessions, which reflects his eagerness to learn. He incorporates feedback constructively and adapts his approach when needed, which is visible in how his analysis and documentation have improved over time.

In terms of communication and collaboration, Ali is very effective in one-to-one and small-group settings. He comes prepared to meetings, shares structured updates, and listens carefully to feedback. One area for growth is becoming more vocal in broader forums. He can further increase his impact by presenting his work more confidently to the wider team and by proactively showcasing key findings in group settings. Overall, his collaboration skills are strong, and he has a positive influence on team dynamics.

## How Ali can be successful during the next half of the internship
To build on the strong start in the first half of the internship, Ali should focus on consolidating his strengths while deliberately addressing a few development areas.

By the end of the internship, the goal is for Ali to have a solid, end-to-end understanding of MDI’s analytics workflows, including how data is generated, modeled, and used by different teams, and how his work contributes to product, risk, and operations decisions. He is already progressing well and should continue deepening his understanding of the digital bank’s metrics and decision processes.

His existing strengths, such as initiative, autonomy, curiosity, and consistent delivery of high-quality work, provide an excellent foundation. Continuing to seek feedback, iterate on his deliverables, and document his work clearly will help make these strengths even more visible.

A key area for growth is visibility and communication at the chapter level. Ali should practice being more vocal in sharing progress, challenges, and results in wider forums, for example by presenting a short summary of his funnel findings in a team meeting, or posting concise written updates that highlight his impact. This will increase his presence, attract additional collaboration opportunities, and ensure that stakeholders across MDI can benefit from his analysis.

As a stretch goal, Ali could lead a small analytics initiative from end to end. For example, he could own the design and delivery of a targeted funnel deep dive or an experiment measurement plan, coordinating with product, risk, and CX stakeholders. This would help him strengthen his project management and leadership skills while still anchored in analytics.

If Ali maintains his current momentum, continues to grow his communication and visibility, and takes ownership of at least one cross-functional analytics project, he will be well positioned for a very strong overall internship outcome. His demonstrated capabilities and attitude suggest significant potential for future roles in data and product analytics.
