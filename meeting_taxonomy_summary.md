# Meeting Taxonomy and Time Allocation Methodology

## Overview

This document explains the rationale and methodology for tracking time allocation during the MDI internship. Understanding how time is spent enables better performance reflection, workload optimization, and professional growth.

---

## Why Track Time Allocation?

### For Interns
- **Self-Awareness:** Understand where your time actually goes vs. where you think it goes
- **Performance Evidence:** Quantify contributions during reviews and reports
- **Optimization:** Identify inefficiencies and rebalance activities toward high-value work
- **Skill Development:** Ensure adequate time for learning and growth activities

### For Managers
- **Workload Monitoring:** Detect burnout risk or under-utilization early
- **Onboarding Quality:** Verify interns receive adequate training and mentorship time
- **Project Scoping:** Better estimate timelines based on actual capacity
- **Team Balance:** Ensure equitable distribution of meeting load and deep work time

### For the Organization
- **Intern Program ROI:** Measure value delivered relative to investment
- **Process Improvement:** Identify bottlenecks in workflows (e.g., excessive meetings)
- **Benchmark Best Practices:** Compare time patterns across high-performing interns

## Time Allocation Categories

### 1. Deep Work (35-45% Target)
**Definition:** Uninterrupted focus time on analytical, technical, or creative tasks.

**Examples:**
- Writing code (Python scripts, SQL queries)
- Data analysis and modeling
- Report writing
- Dashboard design
- Problem-solving sessions

**Why It Matters:**  
Deep work produces the highest-value outputs. Interns should protect this time and minimize context-switching.

**Optimization Tips:**
- Block 2-3 hour windows on calendar as "Focus Time"
- Turn off Slack notifications during deep work
- Batch similar tasks together (e.g., all SQL work in one session)
- Work during your peak productivity hours (morning vs afternoon)

---

### 2. Stakeholder Meetings (25-35% Target)
**Definition:** Synchronous interactions with team members, managers, or cross-functional partners.

**Examples:**
- 1-on-1s with manager
- Team standups and sprint planning
- Cross-functional syncs (product, engineering, marketing)
- Presentations and demo sessions
- Feedback and review meetings

**Why It Matters:**  
Meetings enable collaboration and alignment but can become excessive and reduce deep work time.

**Optimization Tips:**
- Decline meetings without clear agenda or purpose
- Suggest async alternatives for status updates (Slack, email)
- Batch meetings on specific days (Meeting Mondays/Wednesdays)
- Keep meetings to 25 or 50 minutes, not full hour
- End meetings early if objectives are met

---

### 3. Training (10-15% Target)
**Definition:** Structured learning activities to build new skills or deepen expertise.

**Examples:**
- Online courses (Coursera, Udemy, DataCamp)
- Reading technical books or documentation
- Internal workshops and lunch-and-learns
- Shadowing senior team members
- Attending webinars or conferences

**Why It Matters:**  
Internships are learning opportunities first. Adequate training time ensures skill development and long-term career growth.

**Optimization Tips:**
- Schedule learning time weekly, treat it as non-negotiable
- Mix formal courses with on-the-job learning (learn by doing)
- Share learnings with team (reinforces knowledge, builds reputation)
- Track completed courses and certifications for resume

---

### 4. Admin (10-15% Target)
**Definition:** Necessary but low-value tasks that keep operations running.

**Examples:**
- Email management
- Calendar scheduling
- Expense reports and timesheets
- File organization
- Meeting notes transcription

**Why It Matters:**  
Admin work is unavoidable but should be minimized to free time for higher-value activities.

**Optimization Tips:**
- Batch admin tasks (check email 3x/day, not continuously)
- Use email filters and templates to reduce manual work
- Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., Python script for report generation)
- Delegate low-value tasks if possible
- Set "office hours" for quick questions to avoid constant interruptions

---

### 5. Documentation (10-15% Target)
**Definition:** Creating artifacts that enable others to understand, use, or build upon your work.

**Examples:**
- Writing wikis and playbooks
- Code comments and README files
- KPI definitions and data dictionaries
- Process diagrams and flowcharts
- Presentation decks

**Why It Matters:**  
Good documentation multiplies your impact, enables self-service, and reduces future support burden.

**Optimization Tips:**
- Document as you go, not at the end (less rework)
- Use templates to standardize documentation
- Make documentation discoverable (clear naming, searchable wiki)
- Include examples and screenshots for clarity
- Update documentation when processes change

## Measurement Methodology

### Data Collection
**Source:** Calendar events (Google Calendar, Outlook)  
**Granularity:** 30-minute blocks  
**Frequency:** Continuous (auto-logged)

**Manual Categorization:**
- Review calendar weekly
- Tag each event with category (deep_work, stakeholder_meetings, etc.)
- Adjust for multi-tasking (e.g., coding during meeting = 50/50 split)

**Automated Tagging (Advanced):**
- Use calendar event titles as features # 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Generate synthetic data
python generate_data.py

# 3. Load into database
python load_to_sqlite.py

# 4. Run analytics
python analysis.py

# 5. Run data quality checks
python data_quality.py

# 6. Run time allocation analysis
python meeting_taxonomy.py

# 7. Launch dashboard
streamlit run app.py
- Train classifier on labeled data
- Review and correct misclassifications

### Analysis
**Tools:** Python (pandas, matplotlib), Streamlit dashboard  
**Outputs:**
- Time allocation CSV (hours by category)
- Pie chart visualization
- Trend over time (week-by-week)
- Comparison to benchmarks (team average, best practices)

**Cadence:**
- **Weekly:** Quick review, identify imbalances
- **Monthly:** Deep analysis, adjust habits
- **End-of-internship:** Full retrospective, lessons learned

## Interpreting Results

### Healthy Patterns
- **Balanced Distribution:** No single category dominates (>50%)
- **Deep Work Prioritized:** 35-45% of time on high-value tasks
- **Controlled Meetings:** 25-35% in meetings, batched on specific days
- **Learning Investment:** 10-15% on training and skill development
- **Efficient Admin:** <15% on low-value tasks

### Red Flags
- **Meeting Overload:** >40% in meetings, fragmented days, burnout risk
- **Admin Sink:** >20% on low-value tasks, poor automation
- **No Deep Work:** <25% focus time, constant interruptions
- **No Learning:** <5% training time, skill stagnation

### Context Matters
- **Early Internship:** Expect higher training % (20-30%) during onboarding
- **Project Launch:** Deep work % may spike (50-60%) during delivery sprints
- **End of Quarter:** Meeting % may increase (reporting, reviews)

## Actionable Recommendations

### Weekly Rituals
1. **Monday Morning:** Review last week's time allocation, set focus areas
2. **Wednesday:** Mid-week check-in, adjust if off-track
3. **Friday Afternoon:** Categorize calendar events, reflect on patterns

### Monthly Reviews
1. Generate time allocation report (meeting_taxonomy.py)
2. Compare to targets, identify gaps
3. Discuss with manager during 1-on-1
4. Set 1-2 optimization goals for next month

### Optimization Experiments
- **Experiment 1:** "No-Meeting Fridays" (measure deep work increase)
- **Experiment 2:** Batch admin to 4-5 PM daily (measure morning productivity)
- **Experiment 3:** 2-hour focus blocks 3x/week (measure output quality)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I track personal development time outside work hours?**  
A: No, this framework measures work hours only. Personal learning is valuable but separate.

**Q: What if my time allocation doesn't match targets?**  
A: Targets are guidelines, not rules. Early-stage interns may have 25% training, which is fine. Discuss with manager.

**Q: How do I categorize multi-tasking (e.g., coding during a meeting)?**  
A: Use your judgment. If >80% focused on one activity, count it as that category. Otherwise, split 50/50.

**Q: What if I have a project-heavy week with 60% deep work?**  
A: That's fine short-term. Watch for patterns over 4+ weeks. Sustained imbalance may indicate need for adjustment.

**Q: Should I optimize for maximum deep work %?**  
A: No. Some meeting time is valuable (learning from others, feedback, alignment). Aim for balance, not extremes.
